As per initial roadmap, this version of the app introduces the capability for users to send 
queries to Ollama. However, there's a slight twist - currently, it's utilizing the `/api/generate`
endpoint (oops, wrong one! ðŸ˜…).

But fear not! In the next iteration, I'll be implementing the API call using the streaming mode for 
a smoother experience. Consider this just the beginning! ðŸ˜‰

Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy exploring the app!
