Exciting news! I'm thrilled to announce the release of the second version of Olpaka, codenamed 
"Onboarding".

This release marks a significant milestone for our project: the introduction of onboarding.

During the onboarding process, the user, will be guided through a series of instructions and 
configurations to ensure that Ollama and Olpaka are seamlessly working together to deliver the best 
experience possible.

This is just the beginning! The onboarding process is in its initial iteration, and I anticipate it 
evolving over time. Who knows? It might even undergo some significant enhancements or, potentially, 
fade away altogether.

With the basic configuration out of the way, it's time to dive into Model management. Exciting times 
ahead!
