Hello everyone and welcome to the first blog post about my new project... Olpaka!

### What's Olpaka?

I've always had a passion for AI (yes, even before LLM and ChatGPT were a thing!), but now, with LLM 
in the picture, the game has become even more exciting! Recently, I stumbled upon 
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and its 
[extensive collection of frontends](https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#web--desktop).

While randomly exploring that vast list, I noticed a gap - there wasn't anything that was both 
comprehensive and user-friendly.

So, the goal of this project is to give Ollama a user-friendly interface across different platforms, 
starting with the web!

As a software engineer with a keen interest in Flutter, I've chosen this framework as the foundation 
for implementing this project.

### Roadmap

Now, every good project needs some planning, right? Well, I'll be honest - I'm not a fan of 
planning. So, here's a very rough roadmap that I'll probably never stick to.


#### V0.1 - Getting started
- Connect to local Ollama instance
- Implement basic chat

#### v0.2 - Onboarding
- Create onboarding screen
- Check Ollama install
- Check Models
- Check CORS

#### v1.0 - Models galore
- Manage models (list, pull, remove)

#### v1.2 - Makeup time!
- Customize model parameters

#### v1.3 - You're not alone
- Connect to remote Ollama instances

#### v1.4 - Stats for nerds
- Show performance

#### Future development - maybe this will come earlier due to CORS restrictions
- Support Desktop
- Support Mobile
- Add more locales

Stay tuned for more updates! ;)
