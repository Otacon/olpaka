Hello everyone and welcome to the first blog post about my new project... Olpaka!

### What's Olpaka?

I've always had a passion for AI (yes, even before LLM and ChatGPT were a thing!), but now, with LLM 
in the picture, the game has become even more exciting! Recently, I stumbled upon 
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and its 
[extensive collection of frontends](https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#web--desktop).

While randomly exploring that vast list, I noticed a gap - there wasn't anything that was both 
comprehensive and user-friendly.

So, the goal of this project is to give Ollama a user-friendly interface across different platforms, 
starting with the web!

As a software engineer with a keen interest in Flutter, I've chosen this framework as the foundation 
for implementing this project.

### Roadmap
Now, every good project needs some planning, right? Well, I'll be honest - I'm not a fan of
planning. So, [here's a very rough roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap) that I'll probably never 
stick to.

Stay tuned for more updates! ;)
