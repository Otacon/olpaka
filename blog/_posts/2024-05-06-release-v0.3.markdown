Howdy! After some tinkering and encountering a few hiccups with 
[DIO HttpClient and streaming API calls](https://github.com/cfug/dio/issues/1279), I'm excited to 
unveil a new tab on the home screen: the Models management tab.

While implementing this feature, I've realized there are a few areas I need to focus on:
- Finding a workaround for the HTTP client issue;
- Enhancing my understanding of [Ephemeral vs App state management](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/ephemeral-vs-app);
- Deciding whether to keep or revamp the onboarding process.

Despite the challenges, this version has been a valuable learning experience in Flutter, web HTTP 
calls, and more.

My current goal isn't perfection; it's about adding functionality and gaining insights to eventually 
deliver a stable and scalable 1.0 version.
